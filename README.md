# Podcast Pools

_Win episode NFTs from your favorite Podcasts_

## Description

Podcast Pools allows for podcast creators to capture value by having their fans lock up Dai into a no loss lottery where the prize is an NFT that represents that weekâ€™s episode. Similar to Patreon, people can contribute money to creators they support, but instead of directly donating, they are instead giving the interest earned by their capital while it is locked into a v3 Pool Together pool for a chance to win a tokenized episode.

## Resources Used

-   PoolTogether v3 Contracts
-   ERC721 Standard for NFTs
-   IPFS for NFT metadata storage
-   Ethers.js
-   Node/Express Server
-   React Frontend

## System Overview

![alt text](https://github.com/anader123/podcast-pools/raw/master/diagram_images/add-diagram.png "Add Diagran")

**a.** The server is listening to Podcast RSS feed and sees that a new episode has been added.

**b.** The serves then formats the recent episode data and uploads JSON metadata to IPFS.

**c.** The server uses it's private key that has minting access to mint a new episode NFT to the pool contract's address. It creates the NFT with the IPFS hash of the metadata that was stored.

**d.** The NFT contract mints and assigns ownership to the pool contract.

**e.** Lastly, the server then calls a function on the strategy contract to let it know that an NFT episode has been added to the next prize round.

## Token URI Format

**URIs are formatted as ipfs://ipfs/[ipfsHash]**

For example: Querying IPFS with the hash QmQMZA7WZiZUVJqujJX2kbtUu53VmWaF7PhkwqatF9uF8j returns:

```javascript
{
    name:"EthHub Weekly #130",

    description:"SushiSwap drama, crypto market volatility...",

    image:"ipfs://ipfs/QmNfNa7M9tQbRieAbsEnLKKa8UcyHffjMjBaBB1wJGC7hu",

    external_url:"https://podcast.ethhub.io/",

    attributes:[
        {trait_type:"Date", value:"Tue, 08 Sep 2020"},
        {trait_type:"Duration", value:"49:28"}
    ]
}
```
